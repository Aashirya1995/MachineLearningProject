This project focuses on working with data which has a mix of fake news and real news. In today's world fake news is a really big problem. A fake are those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources, or quotes. There are countless sources of fake news nowadays, mostly coming from programmed bots, that can't get tired (they're machines hehe) and continue. to spread false information 24/7.

In this project I worked on detecting fake news collected from different articles.
